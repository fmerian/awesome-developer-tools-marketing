# Contributing to Awesome Developer Tools Marketing

I love your input but I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Adding new resources
- Reporting a broken link
- Suggesting a new category
- Improving the organization or description of resources

## Guidelines for Adding New Resources

- Make sure the resource is truly awesome and provides value to developer tools marketers.
- Add your resource to the appropriate category file (e.g., content-marketing.md).
- If a relevant category doesn't exist, you may create a new one.
- Use the following format: `[Resource Name](link) - A short description ending with a period.`
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

## Updating Your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines. [Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
